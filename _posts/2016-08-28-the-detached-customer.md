# The detached customer

I love clothes, but the fact that we're so detached from the they way they're produced worries me. And after watching the documentary Fifth Estate: Made in Bangladesh I feel even more worried that designers and other top level people in the organizations that sell clothes to us, are just as detached from the creation process as the consumer at the end of the line.
