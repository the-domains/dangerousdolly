# Plastic fantastic?

Plastic is great. Convenient. Lightweigh. Cheap.

It's also toxic. Possibly. Sometimes. Some of it. Or maybe most of it. Potentially.

Why is it so hard to get an answer? If companies avoid saying it's safe in case it isn't and they don't want to be liable, why would they consider selling it? There has to be some kind of business moral, hasn't there?!
