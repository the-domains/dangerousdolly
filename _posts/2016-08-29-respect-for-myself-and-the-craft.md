# Respect for myself and the craft

I love the DIY movement. The grow it yourself gardening renaissance. The "I can do it" and "I want to try that" spirit that seems to sweep across the western world. Like I talk about in an earlier post, the detachment and learned helplessness that industrialism and our consumer society has led to.

The new "trend" of growing, knitting, sewing, baking, pickling and making is a step towards owning your own life. I think, a result of the need to be a participant and a producer, rather than a spectator and naive consumer.

With myself, however, I' ve noticed that this wish of being an active participant leads to a new form of cynicism and a feeling of "no one can be trusted". This feeling is the first step towards getting back in the passive consumer line.

Watching a [documentary on manufacturing luxury goods][0] and comparing it to the documentary on fast fashion I mentioned in yesterday's post, I realized something. The willingness to share with consumers where their product comes from, is exactly the kind of transparency we need going forward! I'll happily pay for a Hermes scarf now that I've seen how much work goes into it, and I'm able to compare the craftsmanship and labour with how I would like to be valued as a person. I'll still likely pick the prettiest or trendiest one, but the product has taken on a meaning outside of showing how rich I am or satisfying me on my next retail therapy trip! (To be honest, I've never before considered giving any of my money to the Hermes brand, but now, who knows, maybe I will...)

The detachment needs to stop in all parts of modern society! The "We didn't know excuse" can't be enough for organizations. And preferably the PR version of transparency needs to be banned, or at least treated as if they weren't even trying.

I strongly believe in modern innovations, technological development and the globalization of the world. But I don't approve of the ever growing economical, human and environmental fraud that people all around conduct fully intentional on an everyday basis. The "every man for himself" idea that prevails in the business world. What businesses can I trust, so that I don't become complacent in creating an economy that stands for things I do not want in my life?
